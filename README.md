# Roomba Challenge

## Getting Started

1. Clone the source code using Git
2. Edit `input.txt` and add your own values
3. Use `npm start` to execute the program

## Using `Input.txt`

The program works by processing a series of commands:

```
5 5 <-- width and height of the room
1 2 <-- Where the Roomba will start
1 0 <-- A patch of Dirt
2 2 <-- A patch of Dirt
2 3 <-- A patch of Dirt (not you can add as much dirt as needed)
NNESEESWNWW <-- Compass directions
```

## Testing the program

1. Open up `test.js` to add a new test case
2. Run `npm test` to execute the test file.
